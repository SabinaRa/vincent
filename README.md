The goal of vincent is to demonstrate you how to write a tidy production-ready Shiny Application from scratch.

## Setup

### Mandatory

In order to attend this tutorial is enough to have R (>3.4), RStudio (best if it is updated) and Git installed on your computer. Dependently on you operative system you can install:

1. install "Git for Windows" [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/) if you use **Windows** 
2. use your favorite package manager if you use **Linux**: i.e. `sudo apt install git`
3. should be integrated in your system if you use **MacOS**.

In order to test that:
1. select *New Project* from RStudio Menu, 
2. *Version Control*
3. *Git*
4. *Repository URL*: `https://github.com/vanlog/vincent`
5. *Create project*

If everything works, your setup is complete. We will develop the package from scratch.

### Optional

This steps are useful only to speed up the installation:

1. `renv::activate()`
2. `renv::restore()`



I am looking forward meeting you!
